# gps_dwell

Greetings! My name is Libby Lisandra.
The purpose of this branch is to share my code to analyse a GPS records in London dataset.

The analysis is mainly about exploring the data and implementing a simple dwelling estimation algorithm.

The dataset can be downloaded/or directly accessed from this link: 

https://gps-london.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/gps.csv)

**Downloading the dataset might be faster to load if you are planning to close the session multiple times.**

If you decide to download the dataset, kindly put it in the same directory as your notebook so that you do not have to specify the path.


Before running the code, kindly install all the necessary libraries (if you have not already).
These are the python libraries that I use:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Datetime
6. scipy.spatial
7. Folium

After installing the library and download the dataset(if this applies), feel free to run through the notebook in the repository. 

**NOTE:** The folium map might not be visible in Github. 

Thank you!
