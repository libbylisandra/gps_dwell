# gps_dwell

Greetings! My name is Libby Lisandra.

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this branch is to share my code to analyse a GPS records in London dataset.

The analysis is mainly about exploring the data and implementing a simple dwelling estimation algorithm.

## 2. Dataset Link
The dataset can be downloaded/ directly loaded into the variable from this link: 

https://gps-london.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/gps.csv)

**Downloading the dataset might be faster to load if you are planning to close the session multiple times.**

If you decide to download the dataset, kindly put it in the same directory as your notebook so that you do not have to specify the path.

## 3. Installing Libraries
Before running the code, kindly install all the necessary libraries (if you have not already).
These are the python libraries that I use:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Datetime
6. scipy.spatial
7. Folium

## 4. Others
After installing the library and download the dataset(if this applies), feel free to run through the notebook in the repository. 

**NOTE:** The folium map might not be visible in Github. 

Thank you!
